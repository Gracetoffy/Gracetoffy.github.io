        <p>I had always seen programming as a really difficult and  I wanted to learn to do it  ,but it always seemed so difficult .<br>
         My dad introduced me to Khan academy when I was in elementary school, then I only used it to learn Maths<br>
          until I came across the Computer programming course and decided to give it a go and it was fun then 
          <br>I started the course on intro to JS.
          Unfortunately due to school , I kinda forgot about it for a while <br>
          and when I remembered I forgot my password 
          so I had to create an entirely new account and start afresh,<br> it was then I regreted ignoring all those notiications telling me to link my account to my email  .<br> 
      I really didn't mind this cause it's has been awhile and I didn't quite remeber somethings .<br>
  Though I didn't complete the Js course, cause it got boring doing the same thing  again,so I decided to start the HTML course.<br>
   It has been really fun and easy , mostly because i took a course on web developing where I learnt a bit of HTML and JavaScript.<br>
Now I can't wait to complete this course and move on to the next one , with no worries of ever losing access to my account cause I linked it to my email.   </p>
